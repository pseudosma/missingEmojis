# The Missing Emojis

## Warning, Abandonware Ahead!

This app was a circa 2011 submission to the AppStore. It has since been removed due to changes to Appleâ€™s store policies put into place a few years after the initial release - namely the need for regular app updates, which I was unable to keep up with.

## Wat dis?

This app was a sticker app before sticker apps existed, providing users with a set of extra emojis to use in text conversations. Due to the technical limitations of older iOS versions, this was a meant to be a stand-alone companion app for text or email, utilizing the clipboard for transferring data. User could use a basic rasterized editor to add a custom set of *emojis* as images, then paste them to the desired app.

The source code includes the original app, plus the two lite versions which were never released.

## Target iOS version and phone model

This app was written in Objective-C and built for iPhone generation 3-4 running iOS 6 or later. If you attempt a build in XCode, please download legacy SDKs to get as close to this version as possible.
